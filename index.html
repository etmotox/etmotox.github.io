<p id="disclaimer">*Disclaimer* this picture is not really me.</p>

<p id="paragragh">I was born and raised in California, yes I am one of them. 
    I was in the Air Force for six years, where I volunteered 
    for a year deployment to Iraq. I moved to Bend in 2011 and
    decided to stay because it was beautiful! I have a wonderful beautiful wife and 
    two little kids who are little monsters.</p>
